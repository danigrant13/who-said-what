    <p><strong>Debriefing for Person Perception and Decision-Making</strong></p>

    <p>Dear Participant,</p>
    <p>During this study, you were asked to read statements made by a variety of different people, complete a memory task, and answer several questionnaires. However, we withheld some information about the actual purpose of the study, which was to understand the attentional processes and cognitive capacities underlying altruistic behavior.</p>
    <p>We were interested in some problems that we couldn’t discuss with you in advance.</p>
    <p>Our major concern in this study is with understanding peoples’ memory and motivational processes when presented information about needy others. While we told you that the study was about understanding how people interpret the statements made by social actors, in reality we were interested in your performance on the memory task. Our main hypothesis was that people who possess motivations to help others would have better recall on the memory task for those who are in need.</p>
    <p>We couldn’t tell you the true purpose of the study because if we did, then the cause of your altruistic behavior would be unknown—that is, we would not know whether your performance on the memory task was based on your knowledge of the true purpose of the study. Now that you see how elaborate the study was and the nature of the ideas we are investigating, I hope you can understand that we couldn’t have tested what we wanted to test without keeping you in the dark about some of the elements of the study.</p>
    <p>You are reminded that your original consent document included the following information: Participation is voluntary. You may feel free to say no to any activity that makes you feel uncomfortable. Participants who withdraw from the study will not be penalized in any way. Your answers will be kept confidential. They will only be seen by the research team or by auditing or compliance officials who are bound to the same confidentiality provisions. If you have any concerns about your participation or the data you provided in light of this disclosure, please discuss this with us. We will be happy to provide any information we can to help answer questions you have about this study. </p>
    <p>We ask that you please not reveal anything about this experiment to your friends or anyone else you know who might also participate in the study down the road. It may be tempting to tell other people, but anyone who knows about the experiment ahead of time won’t give us valid data.</p>
    <p>If your concerns are such that you would now like to have your data withdrawn, and the data is identifiable, we will do so.</p>
    <p>If you have questions about your participation in the study, please contact Dr. Eric Pedersen, at eric.j.pedersen@colorado.edu.</p>
    <p>If you have questions about your rights as a research participant, you may contact the University of Colorado, Boulder Human Research and IRB Office at 303-735-3702.</p>
